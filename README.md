# Gaussian_Process_Numpy
1. This is the code for gaussian process regression, with baysian optimization scheme implemented. 
2. The adjustable kernel parameter will be tuned automatically using a gradient based optimization method.
3. Baysian Optimization, active learning based on Gaussian Process Regression is implemented using gradient ascend on the utility function.
4. However, further improvement could possibly be made by using Particle Swarm Optimization instead to cope with the local minimum issues.
